## A lightweight Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

This is a header-only implementation of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.
Tested with valgrind, no memory leak.

#### Dependencies
On Ubuntu 16.04, install GLUT and OpenGL.
```bash
sudo apt install -y freeglut3-dev
sudo apt install -y mesa-utils
```

Tested by clang++ version 3.8.0 with C++14.

#### Running the demo

```bash
make 
./main
```

* Keyboard 'a' - Start animation.
* Keyboard space - Next Frame.
* Keyboard '1' - Dam break.
* Keyboard '2' - Water Drop.
* Keyboard '3' - Faucet.
* Keyboard 'g' - Switch Grid Visibility.
